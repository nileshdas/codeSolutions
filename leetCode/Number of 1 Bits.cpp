// Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and return the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).



// Example 1:

// Input: 00000000000000000000000000001011
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
