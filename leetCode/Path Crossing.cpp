/*

Given a string path, where path[i] = 'N', 'S', 'E' or 'W', each representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. You start at the origin (0, 0) on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by path.

Return True if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you've previously visited. Return False otherwise.



Example 1:



Input: path = "NES"
Output: false
Explanation: Notice that the path doesn't cross any point more than once.
Example 2:



Input: path = "NESWW"
Output: true
Explanation: Notice that the path visits the origin twice.


Constraints:

1 <= path.length <= 10^4
path will only consist of characters in {'N', 'S', 'E', 'W}
